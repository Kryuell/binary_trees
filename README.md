ALX 0x1D - C Binary Trees Collaboration
Introduction
Welcome to the ALX 0x1D - C Binary Trees Collaboration project, led by Kryuell and Mounimnadir. This project focuses on learning and working with binary trees in the C programming language.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collectively explore binary trees in C, from basic implementations to advanced algorithms. Through collaboration, we aim to enhance our understanding of binary trees and their applications in programming.

Goals
Implement basic binary tree data structures in C.
Learn about traversal algorithms such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
Practice implementing common binary tree operations like insertion, deletion, and searching in C.
Discuss and understand real-world applications of binary trees in computer science and programming.
Contributors
Kryuell: Lead collaborator, experienced in C programming and data structures.
Mounimnadir: Co-lead collaborator, passionate about C programming and problem-solving.
